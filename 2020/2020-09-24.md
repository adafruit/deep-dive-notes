# Deep Dive w/Scott - September 24th, 2020


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


Housekeeping
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After, I’ll unmute and continue.
* Chat with me and a lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* <Any notice about next week’s stream and timing.>
