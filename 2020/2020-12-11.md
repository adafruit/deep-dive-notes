# Deep Dive w/Scott


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube videoâ€™s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.

* Iâ€™m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure heâ€™s ok. After Iâ€™ll unmute and continue.
* Next week is on Thursday and the last stream of the year.

* [11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=682) What is it about the S2 that allows for sleep? Is there anything blocking the M4 or M0 feathers?
* [16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=987) For lowest power, can we reduce the current draw with the 'power' LED in software ( or is it surgery with a soldering iron? )
* [20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=1216) nice. where do you think the NRF52840 boards will be in the pipeline for sleep functionality?

* [30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=1824) a quick question Scott.. when itâ€™s a good idea to use BLE over WiFi?..thanks
* [33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=1997) The CIRCUITPY disk I now have in the Kaluga has only approx 1MB of space. Can that be increased?
* [43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=2635) Where did the name MagTag come from?
* [47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=2861) one minor question. i noticed that in the i2c code you use the Freertos static semaphore in a way that works but isnt really documented. Using the static buffer as the semaphore handle. the api doesnt document that, i found random notes somewhere.
* [53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=3207) To further distract you before we dive in, what happened with the space requirements for those error statements? (I got distracted and missed updates over the past two weeks?)
* [55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlD2dLHkbPg&t=3325) Just a random question Scott(tangent alert) ...can an E ink display be used as a memory storage?.. since they are a persistant display...ðŸ¤”
