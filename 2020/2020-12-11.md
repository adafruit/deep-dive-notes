# Deep Dive w/Scott


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube videoâ€™s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


05:17 Housekeeping
* Iâ€™m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure heâ€™s ok. After Iâ€™ll unmute and continue.
* Next week is on Thursday and the last stream of the year.


10:53 Plan
* 11:22 What is it about the S2 that allows for sleep? Is there anything blocking the M4 or M0 feathers?
* 16:27 For lowest power, can we reduce the current draw with the 'power' LED in software ( or is it surgery with a soldering iron? )
* 20:16 nice. where do you think the NRF52840 boards will be in the pipeline for sleep functionality?
* 21:40 circuitpython2020
* 30:24 a quick question Scott.. when itâ€™s a good idea to use BLE over WiFi?..thanks
* 33:17 The CIRCUITPY disk I now have in the Kaluga has only approx 1MB of space. Can that be increased?
* 43:55 Where did the name MagTag come from?
* 47:41 one minor question. i noticed that in the i2c code you use the Freertos static semaphore in a way that works but isnt really documented. Using the static buffer as the semaphore handle. the api doesnt document that, i found random notes somewhere.
* 53:27 To further distract you before we dive in, what happened with the space requirements for those error statements? (I got distracted and missed updates over the past two weeks?)
* 55:25 Just a random question Scott(tangent alert) ...can an E ink display be used as a memory storage?.. since they are a persistant display...ðŸ¤”
* 59:37 multicore
* 1:13:29 Pin alarm!
* 1:26:16 circuitpython on new chips
