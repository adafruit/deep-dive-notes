# Deep Dive w/Scott


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.

00:05 Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* Next week will be on Friday as well!


Plan
* [08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=490) is circuitpython as powerful as c++ ?
* [13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=781) Is Adriano something totally different from python?
* [14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=860) Is CircuitPython designed for real-time computing?
* [17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=1022) Can you doing threading or multitasking with circuitpython?
* [19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=1197) What program do I want for my raspberry pi game boy for button inputs?
* [22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=1336) Why can't we create a language that's easy to use like python, as fast as C or C++, & is efficiently garbage-collected and memory-managed to be able to do real-time work? Hypothetical question.
* [29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=1748) More in depth question (feel free to skip it) what is a QSTR? I've got a vague idea and see them everyone in the core code but haven't had a chance to dive into them yet
* [34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=2089) USB switch PCB for PPK2
* [36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=2195) Look back on annual thoughts.
* [53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=3183) I forget if you had already answered this in past streams. But how does CP versioning workk? At what point does work on 6.x just become 7.0?
* [57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=3473) When, if at all, do CircuitPython changes go into MicroPython? And the same for MicroPython changes being merged into CircuitPython?
* [1:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=3810) Would you/Adafruit ever consider making CircuitPython an organization on github rather than an Adafruit subproject? Might make it psychologically easier for other orgs to contribute to CircuitPy
* [1:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=3955) ​Having cpy as a fork of mpy means it’s awkward forking/checking out each repo and contributing to both
* [1:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=4540) Scott, could you please elaborate a bit on how someone might best contribute to the documentation?
* #circuitpython2021
* [2:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_08&t=9443) wrap up
