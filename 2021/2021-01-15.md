# Deep Dive w/Scott


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


08:18 Housekeeping
* Dan, myself and others are sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension us, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* Next week will also be on Friday at the normal time.


Plan
* [05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=334) Any further work or investigation on pinalarm and current use?
* [06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=417) @danh Will you have time to work on https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE/issues/37 to support Serial over BLE with other UUID than the Nordic.
* [11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=674) Dan intro
* [17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=1039) ​node-red? interested in your opinion Dan!
* [19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=1189) ParallelBus request from kmatch98: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3600
* [38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=2296) IDF and vendor SDKs
* [43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=2611) So how much work would be required to setup an eink display that requires parallel interface? Would one just have to enable ParallelBus (for a custom board,) or will it require more deep coding in CircuitPython codebase?
* [45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=2758) I have the motor shield v2 module, what is the best compatible SOC module except for Adruino the best platform for circuit python
* [46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=2805) So basically for the displays Adafruit sells, you guys basically had to write something like a "driver" for it? There are no standard ways to talk to displays?
* [47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=2875) Maybe an interesting question on ESP32S2 and the variation on CP maturity. What are the "special hardware support" that you have on older platform that are not there on ESP32S2 yet like: (1) Fast Neopixel with DMA(?) (2) Matrix Hub75 with parallel writing byte on multiple GPIO(?) (3) Rotate IO why is this special(?).
* [51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=3069) ​is it feasible to do PID with a TOF sensor and a stepper (or dc motor) feasible in CircuitPython ?

* [1:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=4599) Dan’s bug fixes
   * [1:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=4717) `git bisect`
   * [1:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=4980) What bug have you fixed that was the most satisfying to find and fix?
   * [1:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=5135) If you want to keep it clean, do an interactive rebase on your branch before merging
   * [1:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=5259) Is what you just discuss relate to the monotonic precision, and how it decrease over time? Should we have a way to "reset" the monotonic? Or is there a way?
   * [1:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=5337) Is bisec smart about the size of the commit? Trying to find a place where half of the change are before or after.
   * [1:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=5371) satisfying bug to fix
   * [1:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=5737) watchpoint
   * [1:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=6104) Are there Adafruit board that do USB Host. And any plan to have some kind of support in CP?
   * [1:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=6321) in progress bug hunt 1:53:42
1:50:00 - basic python demo
   * [2:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=7481) 6.1.0-rc.1
   * [2:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_01_15?t=7980)
