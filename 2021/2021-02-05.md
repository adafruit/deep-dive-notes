# Deep Dive w/Scott for February 5th, 2021


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


07:47 Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and a lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome. Next week is on Friday.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.


Plan
* Questions
* Audio on RP2040
* 13:32 - tiny uft channel created
* 15:00 Scott’s FPGA fantasy:  ( no credit to dcd :-) )
William D Jones Is working on adding Lattice MachXO2 support to the OS FGPA Tools https://twitter.com/cr1901/status/1356042679608606721
* 15:40 ​Is UART planned in CircuitPython for the Pico?
* 18:00 Ryzen discussion ( 5 seconds to build rp2040 build on ASUS ROG Crosshair VIII Hero, while rpi build took minutes )
* 22:24 I tried looking at sleep on the nrf, can you explain the esp32s2 code and where the calls would differ? Also, where do the nrf specific libraries live?
* 23:49 Sleep. Continued 
* 27:28 NRF datasheet 5.2.1.1 
* 32:00 NFR power on github
* 35:27 Circuit Python in space satellite - see adafruit blog - https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/02/inside-the-v-r3x-space-mission-circuitpython-is-now-in-space-circuitpython-space-maholli404/
* 38:40 Adafruit AR app for RP2040 and iOS
* 47:24 Audio on the Adafruit Feather!  
* 51:20 review code.py for audio
* 52:30 foamyguy streaming tomorrow morning 10am central time
* 53:00 back to code.py…
* 53:50 Logic analyzer ( Logic 2 )
* 55:30 PWM output - verified that the code doesn’t work :-)
* 57:30 Stema Speaker for audio
* 1:10:30 RP2040 Datasheet for PWM
* 1:15:08 audio_dma.c code
* 1:17:33 Ladyada / mystery guest
* 1:20:01 Arm vs RISCV choice ( Why do you think they went with ARM and not RISCV? )
* 1:22:26 @arturo182 has the same RP2040 Zero sized so you both have one and wait for the chip?
* 1:23:30 Adding easy for people to add new boards to CP ( RP 2040 might bring the board count to 200 )
* 1:26:30 Audio algorithm discussion PWM / sine wave
* 1:28:00 Timers on RP 2040
* 1:31:50 Not enough pins on the “gameboy” thing 
* 1:35:17 - Issue #4 - buffering data from the adc…
* 1:42:02 WM 8960  for I2S ( UDA chip discontinued )
* 1:44:42 - goodbye LadyAdy
* 1:45:00 resync / questions ….
* 1:48:45 X-Ray scans ( also decapped RP 2040 ) https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster/status/1355093011923750912
* 1:52:40 RP 2040 interpolator and divider peripherals
* 1:54:22 Interpolator in the Datasheet 2.3..1 SIO ( under Processor subsystem )
* 2:00:00 UART from PrimeCell UART (PL011)
* 2:01:20 back to Interpolator
