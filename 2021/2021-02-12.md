Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.

Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome. Next week is on Friday.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.

* [18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=1110) ​Can I implement a high speed counter in PIO? Cycle accurate at 50Mhz would be fantastic and could replace hardware or fpga currently required in our lab

* [32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=1949) CP potential of ESP32-C3
* [34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=2053) If we get BLE workflow, then would the old ESP32 interesting again for CP?
* [34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=2092) Would it be easier to use a different RISC-V dev board for porting CP?

* [47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=2865) still need to figure out what those people doing Matrix (Hub75) over I2S are doing and why it make sense to them. Do they make a "sound" picture and run in loop?
* [48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=2905) continued audio I2S deep dive/introduction
* [50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_12?t=3000) but maybe you don't want to 'hold' the speaker in a single position for a long time?
… You will get a slight pop if you suddenly go to repeating values, but it's nowhere near as bad as stopping BCLK!
