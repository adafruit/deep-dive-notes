# Deep Dive w/Scott for February 18th, 2021


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.

* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome. Next week should be on Friday.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.

* [17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=1045) Extra UART CDC
* [23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=1423) Would MP3 decoding run on the other core?
* [26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=1606) by the way I'm not sure I grasped what chips can have the secondary CDC, it looks like the M0, but also the ESP32S2 don't have enough USB endpoints ?
* [27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=1654) pico 8 strand neopixel demo
* [34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=2083) This is probably not cost effective, but can you replace the shift register with a machXO tiny fpga, and instead of optmizing the code on the side of cpy, just do it on the fpga?
* [35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=2109) Hello. what is RP2040?
* [38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=2282) So is Limor going to do a board with that shift registor and 8 connector for neopixel strip?
* [43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=2583) Can you talk a bit about implementing a high speed counter running in the PIO?
* [41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=2471) Need a RP2040 signal analyser to work on PIO and see what I am doing…

* [1:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=3722)
* [1:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=4973) bitops only for RP2040?
* [1:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=5004) Question: would you rather contributors merge their own work (once approved) or if say I do a review of Jeff's code and say yup this is fine, choose to merge it? Or wait for one of the maintainers to do it
* [1:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=5567) bye jeff
* [1:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=6198) Has anyone asked, why did pi develop their own chip?
* Questions
* [1:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=3726) Re-review jepler’s PR:  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4219
* Perhaps trying to use JLink to debug PIO problem
* [1:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_18?t=7177) wrap up
