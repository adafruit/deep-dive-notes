# Deep Dive w/Scott for February 26th, 2021


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


06:29 Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Next week will be on Thursday!
* Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
*

Plan
* Pimoroni Boards!
* RP2040 UART
* Rotaryio
* Flash system rework


Timecodes
* [12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_26&t=737) will there be a rp2040 board with wifi on it?
* [13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_2021_02_26&t=812) Would it possible theoretically to have a module that works in the background kind of like rotaryio or gamepad but is responsible for reading touch screen data and queuing it up to return to the foreground coded when requested?

I cannot find something that says "USB host present"
