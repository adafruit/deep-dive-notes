# Deep Dive w/Scott for April 23rd, 2021


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


5:15Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* 7:40 Next week will be on Friday.

Timestamps
* 1:43 @2:01pm Housekeeping ( 5:15 - above ) adjusted below
* 8:04 hellos
* 9:03 CircuitPython intro…
* 9:16 ( 9:11 ) clap
* 10:05 Micropython updates / release notes for 6.2.0 based on Jun 2018 Micropython!
* 11:34 Talk of CP 7.0 - mpy version revisit
* 11:40 Will circup know what mpy to take based on version of the board? (yes)
* 15:10 How will the learn guide new zip thing behave?
* 16:25 Plan for multiple merges from MP to CP
* 17:25 MP v1.10 merged in S3
* 18:20 Merge conflict battles…
* 19:20 Damien's doing faster release cycles now as well - since 1.13, so CP Is going to really want to stay updated more often going forward.
* 20:45 Sublime Merge
* 22:01 plans to support the Arduino Portenta?
* 22:45 Are each of the 1.1x going to be tested, or we only care about the last one?
* 26:15 anything particular you're looking for in the merge reviews? looked through the 1.11 PR, and built it for the RP2040.
* 28:28 The changelog will be crazy…
* 29:20  the merge process explained
* 32:15 Maybe we can get community to run automation on different boards …
* 32:40 Arduino Portenta dual core M7/M4
* 33:48 Does the toolchain allow for a code builder front end ?(edited)
* 35:08 How often is this done?
* 36:40 Micropython release notes
* 37:45 Is there a difference in merging the change from MP into CP... and redoing the change from CP into the last MP? (does that make sense)
* 39:30 v1.10
* 40:16 CP translation considerations ( new strings?)
* 42:30 MP (native/machine code) emitters
* 43:22 thought CircuitPython already supported underscores in numeric literals. On 6.2.0 on QT Py, I can do a = 1_000_000; print(a) and it's a number
* 43:57 v1.11
* 45:50 mpy-cross & mpy-tool 
* 45:52 will testing with .py possibly give different results from testing with .mpy?
* 48:22 v1.12
* 51:25 littlefs (vs. FAT )
* 56:56 What on chip peripherals are used for a Neo pixel ? One channel of a timer ?
* 58:20 v1.13
* 1:06:39 Was there a time where people were saying that using foo and bar make IT less accessible and it is not good for STEM and being open? Is that still the opinion?
* 1:07:03 With threading an interrupts couldn't we just write them in a c code block to use that inside circuit python?
* 1:09:12 v1.14
* 1:12:00 Could you rename the cp Ports folder do eliminate all these naming conflicts ?
* 1:15:20 v1.15
* 1:22:07 v1.11 merge failing checks…
* 1:24:20 git worktree
* 1:26:23 ​Is there a specific CPython version that you target compatibility with? (2.7, 3.9, etc)
* 1:27:45 fixing atmel-samd build error (openbook_m4)
* 1:35:04 Git commit --amend and cherry picking…
* 1:37:00 Are you getting the diff between MP's v1.x and v1.(x+1), and then cherry-picking that?
* 1:38:25 So how are you bringing in the per-release changes from MP?
* 1:40:55  Scott’s  ‘other project’ / use git to store laws / HB1336 - 2021-22
* 1:52:40 Uniform Electronic Legal Access
* 1:53:55 RCW (current state)
* 1:55:00 wa-log.org
* 1:56:50 adoc (asciidoc) vs markdown
* 2:04:56 Gitlab allows adding users
* 2:11:06 Bills and terms of service agreements are things I wish I could track history of it better
* 2:11:30 completely different question from the topic. why adafruit nrf52840 still using softdevice 6.1.1 stack instead of 7.2.0(because of different memory layout)?
* 2:14:12 (4:10pm) wrap up
* 2:15:30 - headset off (4:12 pm)
