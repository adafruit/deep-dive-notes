* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* [7:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Qt4mRoyBo&t=460) Next week will be on Friday.

* [1:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Qt4mRoyBo&t=5820) Are you getting the diff between MP's v1.x and v1.(x+1), and then cherry-picking that?
* [1:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Qt4mRoyBo&t=5905) So how are you bringing in the per-release changes from MP?
