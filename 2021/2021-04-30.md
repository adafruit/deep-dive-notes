# Deep Dive w/Scott for April 30th, 2021


Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* <Any notice about next week’s stream and timing.>

* 1:07:20 GC collect - assign 0 to support collecting
* 1:09:20 under 200 files to merge left
* 1:14:50 assign 0, then gc vs. del for freeing memory
* 1:17:09 using del() to unimport
* 1:17:64 ​Does CircuitPython run any hardware CI to make sure there are no regressions on supported boards?
* 1:19:35 pairheap - we probably want it :-)
* 1:26:00 we don’t use mod microsocket
* 1:28:15 Jeff found places where we don’t have tests…
* 1:29:12 mp thread
* 1:31:00 frzqstr.py
* 1:32:44 in the py folder!
* 1:36:45 CP has more support in ‘struct’ and turn off non-standard stuff
* 1:42:35 py/compile.c  # emit bytecode
* 1:45:35 walrus operator?  PN_annassign
* 1:48:50 native mpy files? … emitbc.c # emit bytecode
* 1:52:25 yes - it’s nice to merge each milestone

* 2:09:12 some things that don’t belong in the py folder…
* 2:11:50 community broadband…
* 2:14:25 FCC interested in learning users broadband speeds https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/
