# Deep Dive w/Scott


Hi all, this doc is to try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.


Housekeeping
* I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
* Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
* Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
* Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.
* <Any notice about next week’s stream and timing.>


Plan
* Next week - likely Friday (“is fine”)
* Transfer files over bluetooth

* 0:27:45 circuitpython/web-editor repo
* 0:28:00 adafruit/ble-file-transfer-js 
* ​0:29:00  works in Chrome then it should work in Deno ... As that's V8 under the hood and they are making their JavaScript isomorphic. (Works in browser, works in Deno.)
* 0:30:00 - CP save button - use timer instead
* 0:30:45 codemirror.net/6 editor 
* 0:31:40  https://deno.land/
* 0:32:59 Does code mirror handle python/ :blinka:  stubs?
* 0:34:10 use absolute latest CP from amazon and NRF 8240(Sp)
* 0:35:21 nice to add autocomplete
* 0:35:45 now, to test it on the Micro:bit v2 
* 0:36:40 device disconnects after writes
* 0:37:10 some code outthere to user antlr with Monaco, since antlr can generate parsers in many languages including JS and TS
* 0:37:30 there is a python parser in codemirror
* 0:37:52 microbit V2
* 0:39:15 that’s how you know you are in a deep dive - when alpha 3 is too old
* 0:40:45 new git microbitv2 repo
* 0:42:10 CircuitPython Online Editor 
* 0:42:45 JS question - how to show a file directory 
* 0:44:00 microbit v2 cpu nRF52833

* 0:47:18 searching for microbit v2 schematic from tech.microbit.org/hardware/schematic
* 0:50:20 schematic displays MicroBit_V2.0.0_S_schematic.PDF
* 0:51:40 Where can I find documentation on Adafruit_PIOasm? - readthedocs.io pioasm latest
* 0:55:11 edit the pinouts on Expansion connector
* 0:57:14 how microbit references the pins and map them to CP internal names
* 0:57:40 and buttons - to match board creators documentation
* 0:58:59 microbit documentation  
* 1:00:25 Edge connector pins
* 1:02:15 If the MicroBit v2 doesn't expose USB, how does one install CircuitPython onto it? Does it have a Bluetooth-enabled bootloader?
* 1:04:43 make -j 32 BOARD=microbit_v2 ( fix errors )
* 1:09:10 this is the first time we built CP Non-usb BLE only device
* 1:11:20  how to send data over laser.. Is PWM the way to go?
* 1:13:30 resolve linker undefined symbols
* 1:15:45  this is the birth of USB-less CP
* 1:22:35 always a good idea to do a make clean and try again when experiencing CP build problems
* 1:26:30 Serial_write_substring undefined
* 1:28:00 ​you can't raise an exception from boot py / goes to boot.out
* 1:36:00 - it’s too big :-(
* 1:39:00 review the configuration flags
* 1:41:45 play the make it fit game - turn off POW3
* 1:43:20 ​Is your USB / BT a subset of something else? So you can access it through another doorway?
* 1:43:48 - got 500 bytes back
* 1:45:48 look what does the “simmel”  do -Os
* 1:46:45 nrf52833 flash size (- 512KB Flash )
* 1:47:50 Refer to the linker file template common.lk
* 1:50:30 What is that magic optimization and why would it not always be enabled?
* 1:53:40 What is soft device ( binary blob from nordic )
* 1:55:40 using S140 SoftDevices   https:nordicsemi.com/products/nrf52833
* 1:58:00 Consider peripheral only / what is S113 size 
* 2:00:00 Soft device memory resource map
* 2:02:35 softdevice provided by Dynastream ( thisisant.com )
* 2:04:37 S140 release notes
* 2:07:57 end by trying out the binary 
* 2:08:13 not sure if downloading the hex file did anything
* 2:09:14 next step - connect a debugger
* 2:10:45 microbit will take some more work 
* 2:11:45 wrap up
* 2:13:48 -bye all
