* [0:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqZKgXoxzY&t=2925)  lldb is using the protocol differently as the gdb/lldb side is not specified only the side of the server or the other way around
* [0:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqZKgXoxzY&t=3025) in any case... if you implement a client you have trouble making sure it will work with another implementation. that is why LLDB does not always work, same thing with other debuggers
* [0:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqZKgXoxzY&t=3172) (trying to add support for Black Magic Probe to radare2 was a nightmare... as they use the protocol "wrong"). real time debugging in radare2 was not a priority when we looked at it . so the architecture was really bad to try implementing it

* [1:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrqZKgXoxzY&t=3662) Update from @esden So ... I am streaming every Tuesday on twitch. Working on different projects. Still waiting for parts for Glasgow. On stream we are working on icebreaker-bitsy.projects.   We made an FPGA mechanical keyboard. Atreus keyboard conversion with FPGA instead of an MCU.  Now we are working on a Demoscene/gameconsole hardware with the icebreaker-bitsy inside. Working on a new revision of black magic probe too... to compensate for chip shortages and add some new features.  @smunaut streamed the other day and got Linux to boot on the icebreaker. And it is a usable Linux not the AVRLinux thing that takes a day to boot.  20s boot time
