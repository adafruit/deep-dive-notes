* [0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=0) Getting Started and Hellos
* [5:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=303) Housekeeping
* [7:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=472) What is the status of strategy / plan for an RTOS or real-time executive?
* [13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=800) What was the first computer language that you learned and what is your all time favorite?
* [16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=991) What are the arguments for switching to circuitpython vs the usual arduino IDE ?
* [20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=1227) How many circuit python boards has ever Adafruit made?
* [22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=1336): How do we as hobbyist debug CricuitPython? Other than a bunch of print statements.
* [24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=1497) How about that steroids game?
* [29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=1755) Actually that prompts a question--are you a developer that needs new challenges constantly? Does that drive the new projects, like the balance board?
* [37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=2258) What was the biggest change in 7.0.0?
* [44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=2648) ​Speaking of status LED. I noticed the PyPortal, MatrixPortal, and esp32spi_wifimanager have a neopixel status LED for wifi. Curious why the wifi shared-bindings library doesn't do status led.
* [55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=3356) This is always interesting to hear a dev explain... What do you typically look for when doing a PR review …
* [1:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=3713) Is there any performance to be gained from having many instructions on one line opposed to spreading things out vertically, which most seem to do?
* [1:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=3941) I worked a place that had a really in depth review process and you could spend the time to understand it not only to review the code but so everyone was familiar with the whole system.
* [1:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=4266) Oh circuitpython is compiled and not just interpreted ?
* [1:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=4436) ​Where do hardware drivers (written in C) fit in (like keymap)
* [1:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=4596) ​Made sense... Thanks. Is it possible to add your own C code drivers?
* [1:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=5155) How do the core devs for circuit python divide up the work/of knowledge base of the core. How do you dive in and learn more/refer to someone else when it's not a problem you're familiar/experienced with, etc?
* [1:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=5453) Other than the saleae, what tools do you use to help during this?
* [1:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=6891) Any recommend arduino compatible RISC-V MCU board?
* [2:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaLtpXjhSMg&t=7345) wrap-up
