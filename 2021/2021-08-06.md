# Deep Dive w/Scott for August 6th, 2021 (CircuitPython Day!)

Hi all, this doc is try and track topics and timecodes for my deep dive stream. These notes will end up in the YouTube video’s description. Any help keeping them groomed as I stream is welcome.

## Housekeeping
I’m sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython. Support them, and by extension me, by purchasing hardware from https://adafruit.com
Chat with me and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome.
Heads up that the cat is epileptic. If he has a seizure I will mute and watch him to make sure he’s ok. After I’ll unmute and continue.

Assuming that at some point more pythonic style threading gets implemented, would either circuit python or micro python run into GIL like issues? (GIL: Global Interpreter Lock)
* [0:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9NhQ0F9054&t=1284) go over the MP_STATE_VM stuff and when to use it instead of global variable declaration... the context being your review comment on the atexit PR #5077

It supports arduino, Pi Pico and they are going to release ESP32 soon. It's got support for keyboard matices, LEDs including 7 segment, and you can connect a virtual logic analyzer. It does single step debugging as well and handles PIO with debugging on the Pi Pico. It also does micropython and they just started working on CP. It's at https://wokwi.com/
