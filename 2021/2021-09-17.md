Join Scott as he explores bare metal programming a Raspberry Pi to try and get TinyUSB going on one. He'll also answer any questions folks have.

Chat with Scott and lot of others on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.
Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific but occasionally shifted to Thursday at 2pm. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome. Next week will be on Friday.
