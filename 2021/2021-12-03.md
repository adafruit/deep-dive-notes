- [0:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1026) look for ‘latest’ branch in tannewt’s github reto to find current work
- [0:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1085) broadcom changes checked into main !

- [0:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1765) ive been trying to get WPE running on the pi zero 2w and that has been almost impossible to figure out ( webkit for embedded )
- [0:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1244) Broadcom stuff caused people to download 20Gb /submodules /and other tricks to reduce download  ( fetch submodules )

- [0:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1602) debugging circuitpython should be a guide as well
- [0:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1738) learn building circuit python page
- [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1770) what is “learn”
- [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=1860) Any idea why DAC output in esp32 was responding with three different voltage levels with 10s latency to sent signal instead of Linear 256 levels?

- [0:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=3155) Create a new guide
- [0:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=3175) choosing a name for the guide - search for other names
- [0:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=3530) Overview page
- [1:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=3620) Can anyone write these learn guides?
- [1:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=4003) Adafruit NeoSlider, do you have any experience with it to rate readings stability?
- [1:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=4032) Installation
- [1:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=5494) Connecting - USB host/device
- [1:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=6860) assume USB host-iness is not yet part of the CirPyRasPiNoOS?
- [1:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=6933) Switch to ESP / ble workflow
- [1:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42I5RUkFwcQ&t=6962) Wrap Up
