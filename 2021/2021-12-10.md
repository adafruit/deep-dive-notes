- [6:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=384) Is the flash needed less on those CP targets without USB ?
- [7:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=448) sleep update
- [11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=660) Hi Scott - got a ? on the nrf52 bootloader and where/who should set the bootloader config regarding the CRC check and setting the bit for \"app valid\" bit in the bootloader config register of the nrf52xxx Should it be done at the bootloader and set it to assume a good app? or should it be done at the application level where the crc might be computed and flashed at the same time as the application. Perhaps Thach would know more…

- [1:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=4593) Where does the Neopixel code live in CircuitPython?
- [1:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=4820) Start implementing Neopixel for the CircuitPython RaspberryPi port
- [1:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=5419) Q: I can’t build today’s CircuitPython latest. Scott: A good place to followup is in the #circuitpython-dev channel on Adafruit Discord or open an issue in GitHub.
- [1:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=5452) Back to implementing Neopixel
- [1:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6036) What speed should data be sent to the FIFO and how is that controlled?
- [1:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6142) Let’s see if it builds and works! What could go wrong?
- [1:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6275) Oops. First a code.py that uses the Neopixel needs to be on the Raspberry Pi
- [1:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6376) Setting up Salea Logic analyzer for neopixel to monitor the Raspberry Pi
- [1:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6436) It didn’t work, debugging
- [1:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6483) Todbot: That neopixel analyzer is pretty cool!
- [1:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6570) print debugging in CircuitPython
- [1:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6880) Q: Will CP for RPi understand HMD_cvt and HDMI_drive in config.txt so I can configure a 5 inch HDMI LCD from Waveshare?
- [1:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=6926) Back to the broadcom data sheet and debugging continues
- [1:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRgIhPJnDQ&t=7044) Wrapping up and Goodbye for 2021. Next Deep Dive is tentatively on 7 January 2022. Happy New Year!
