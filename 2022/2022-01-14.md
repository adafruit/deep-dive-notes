- [49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbP3uE5-pE&t=2980) not a priority, but any more thoughts on allowing either FS access to the OTA partitions if folks want, or a way to disable OTA to reclaim more flash space for those that want?
- [50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbP3uE5-pE&t=3027) OTA update process
- [51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbP3uE5-pE&t=3090) is OTA exclusive to ESP?
