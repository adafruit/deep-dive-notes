# Deep Dive w/Scott: BLE GATT on ESP32-S3

Join Scott as he continues bluetooth low energy (BLE) GATT client code on the ESP32-S3.

Chat on the Adafruit Discord at https://adafru.it/discord.

Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific. Next week is on Friday.

All notes are available on GitHub with links into the videos. Thanks to @askpatrickw and @dcd for making and maintaining the notes. https://github.com/adafruit/deep-dive-notes/
