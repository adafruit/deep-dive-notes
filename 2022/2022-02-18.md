Deep Dive happens every week. Normally Fridays at 2pm Pacific. Typically goes for two hours or more. Questions are welcome. Next week is on Friday and is the second to last deep dive from me for a while.

All notes are available on GitHub with links into the videos. Thanks to @askpatrickw and @dcd for making and maintaining the notes. https://github.com/adafruit/deep-dive-notes/
