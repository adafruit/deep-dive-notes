# Deep Dive w/Scott: More USB Host API

Join Scott as he answers questions and further discusses the USB Host API for CircuitPython.

Next week will be on Friday at 2pm Pacific and be the last stream with Scott as host for a while. Foamyguy will stream in the time slot starting in two weeks.

- [2:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkAmhqe3m8A&t=7520) ​if the pins were not defined for device mode, why add them for host mode?
- [2:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkAmhqe3m8A&t=7659) wrap up / next week with Scott, then foamyguy taking over
